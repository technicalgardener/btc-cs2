/*
With the Vehicle object, you can store a vehicle's whole vin (which is broken up stored as three independent variables: v1, vin, v3), a vehicle's price, and the number of weeks the vehicle has been on the lot.
Custom options can also be stored into each vehicle object. To do this, it reads the numerical value of listSize and grabs that number of (option) lines listed below that vehicle and can store them within a
sperate dynamic array using the string pointer listPtr. It includes several tools listed below to help modify the data within.
